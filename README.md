#Network Science

What I learn and analyze through the master's degree. I make a few Python codes which reflect the chosen network model(scale-free configuration model network) and extract data from it. Then, I analyze them. .PDF files are result from this research and .py files are codes what I run.

- CMSF_generate.py : generate ensembles of configuration-model scale-free(CMSF) networks
                     and save edge lists, and network properties as text files.
- GF_solve.py : analyze the network by using saved files from CMSF_generate.py. 
                We use the generating function methond to do it. So the name is GF_solve.
